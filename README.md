Introduction
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the insurance costs for individuals based on their age, Body Mass Index (BMI), and the number of children they have. By analyzing these factors, the model aims to provide accurate insurance cost estimations.

Features
Input Parameters:

Age
BMI
Number of Children
Output:

Predicted Insurance Cost
Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-cost-prediction.git
cd insurance-cost-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the model for predicting insurance costs, follow these steps:

Ensure all dependencies are installed as per the Installation section.
Run the prediction script with the required input parameters:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --age 35 --bmi 24.5 --children 2
Alternatively, you can use the Jupyter notebook provided in the repository to interactively input data and see predictions.

Model
The model used for prediction is built using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized for training includes various features such as age, BMI, and the number of children. The model is trained to recognize patterns and relationships between these features and insurance costs.
